* A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers     
  over the button and this selected button can then be styled

*How users can get started with the project*
1. We start with proposed concept that the user wants to use
2. The user then starts to write an html file with in VS studio with heading , body & footer
3. The user then must add in images that the want in there webpage and also create an external CSS file which helps design the webpage how te user wants
4. see if the page is working and also that what we added is working eg. responsive images , backgrounds etc.
